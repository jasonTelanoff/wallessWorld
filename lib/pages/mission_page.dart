Since then, several more walls have been broken down. The wall separating my kitchen from my living room, as an example, has been broken down. Dozens of walls at my school, Samohi, have been broken down. Protesters spent hours of their lives fighting to break down the tall, sturdy wall that is racism, and have only slightly chipped it.',

But he canâ€™t do it alone. With the work of Admiral Ries, the two have already gotten five countries to sign into the agreement, pledging to become part of the non-nation of WallessWorld, with talks for several more on the way.',
